# Reticulum-Socket-Bridge

I don't pose this as the best idea, or even a good idea, but it's a functional idea. It has a stunningly narrow scope deliberately. This is designed specifically to encapsulate byte arrays between Python and other languages.

This is purely meant as a stopgap until the language in question natively supports Reticulum.
